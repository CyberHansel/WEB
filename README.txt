$ sudo ss -tlnp                                     #lists all the open network ports on your server, along with the process ID (PID) and name of the program that is listening on each port. You can look for entries with the "State" column set to "LISTEN", which means that a program is actively waiting for incoming connections on that port.

$ curl -k http://<HTTP_server>/bootstrap.ign         #The -k option is a flag used with the curl command-line tool that stands for "insecure" and is short for --insecure. When this option is used, curl will not verify the SSL/TLS certificate presented by the HTTP server. This means that curl will accept any certificate, even if it's invalid or self-signed.
